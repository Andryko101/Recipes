    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This hearty, spicy beef stew is only for those that can handle the heat. I prefer to make it in the slow cooker, but it can be made stove top also. Great served over mashed potatoes or rice.
    </p>
    <ul><h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound beef stew meat</li>

    </ul><br>
    <ol><h2>Directions</h2>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown the beef on all sides. Remove from skillet, reserving juices, and season with salt and pepper.
